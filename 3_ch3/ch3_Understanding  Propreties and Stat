** Is state the dynamic part of the component
* Yes. Change them with setState function. 

** Difference state vs properties
* properties are passed from another component. 

** Why do we set initial state, what happens if we dont?
*  Not setting initial state will either fail or render something unexpected. 

** Setting new (setState() ) state is actually a merge. Explain. 
* when using the setState() function we are actually setting doing a merge, updating, adding values and keeping the old ones when there are no new ones defined. 

** Use of setTimeout.
* setTimeout canbe used to execute a function after x ms. I ve seen it used to make a sparkling button. 

** changing the name of a component or a function ( functional component) might be useful. How can it be done? (hint on imports)
* lets say i want render from reat-dom then to change its name i can write:
import render as renderJSX from react-dom. This way i will user renderJSX as if it where render and I can define render it my component with no conflict. 

** What is a functional componet.
* A component that onnly renders JSX, it has no state and no lyfecycle methods. 

** What is a pure function
* a function that given the same arguments will always produce the same output.
